## Part 1.
- Lucas is also known for inventing the <u>tower of Hanoi puzzle</u>

## Part 2
### 2b
- when n is large (n>40), the ratio of calculations and times round down to about **1.6**, which is the approximately the  golden ratio.
- Order of growth: $O(b^n)$
  - since the function increase by a constant b, where b ≈ 1.6 , we know that our sequence has an exponential run time order similar to $O(b^n)$
    - b ≈ 1.6

### 2c
- Custom Function: myAnnacci
  - initial conditions
  - N(0) = 0
  - N(1) = 1
- The ratios of successive calculations and time are approximately 1.6, which is the golden ratio, and also the same calculation and time ratios for the Lucas' Fibonacci sequence
- Order of growth: $O(b^n)$
  - For the same reason Lucas' Fibonacci sequence has $O(b^n)$ runtime , my custom sequence has Order of growth: $O(b^n)$  runtime
    - b = 1.6

## Part 3
- Sum for each row/column/etc: 33
### 3c
- The greatest number of combinations is 66, which is two times the magic sum (33)
- There are 1364 different combinations that sum up to 66
