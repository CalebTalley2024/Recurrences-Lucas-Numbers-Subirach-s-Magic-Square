### 1. Lucas is also known for ____________ FILL IN LATER

### 2b  all numbers are close to 1.6, which is the square root of the golden ratio
        since the function increse by a contsant the is similar to 1.6 (b), we know that our run time is of order exponential (b^n)
        b is the constant

### 2c 
- Custom Function: myAnnacci
- The ratio of successive calculations is close 1.6 again
- Order of growth: exponential (b^n)
