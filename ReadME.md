## Part 1.
- Lucas is also known for inventing the <u>tower of Hanoi puzzle</u>

## Part 2
### 2b
- when n is large (n>40), the ratio of calculations and times round down to about **1.6**, which is the approximately the  golden ratio.
- Order of growth: $O(b^n)$
  - since the function increase by a constant b, where b ≈ 1.6 , we know that our sequence has an exponential run time order similar to $O(b^n)$
    - b ≈ 1.6

### 2c
- Custom Function: myAnnacci
  - initial conditions
  - N(0) = 0
  - N(1) = 1
- The ratios of successive calculations and time are approximately 1.6, which is the golden ratio, and also the same calculation and time ratios for the Lucas' Fibonacci sequence
- Order of growth: $O(b^n)$
  - For the same reason Lucas' Fibonacci sequence has $O(b^n)$ runtime , my custom sequence has Order of growth: $O(b^n)$  runtime
    - b = 1.6

## Part 3
- Sum for each row/column/etc: 33
### 3c
- The greatest number of combinations is 66, which is two times the magic sum (33)
- There are 1364 different combinations that sum up to 66
- 
## Bonus Questions
The Subirach Magic Square is actually called the "33-magic square". 
This puzzle was made by the architech Subirachs.
The "33-magic square" puzzle was first made in the Passion façade, where Subirachs started construction in 1987. 
The "33-magic square" puzzle was made again in various other places across the Basilica.

As we know. we can individually add the rows, columns, diagonals, corners, center, and “postage stamps” to the same sum: 33.
The number 33 is significant to the Romans because that is the age Jesus Christ was when he was crucified.
